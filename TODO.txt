TODO list for tcLex, last updated 07/20/1999:
(unsorted)

- Add various input types: string, variable, file, channel. Add 
corresponding switches to eval and start.

- Add multiple input buffers, possibly using the following syntax:

    # create a buffer <name>
    # equivalent to yy_create_buffer
    # original buffer is named "initial" or {}
    # option could be -file, -channel... default to string
    <lexer> buffer create <name> ?option? <source>            

    # switch to buffer <name>
    # equivalent to yy_switch_to_buffer
    <lexer> buffer switch <name>
  
    # query the buffer list
    <lexer> buffer list

    # return the current buffer
    <lexer> buffer ?current?
  
    # delete a buffer
    <lexer> buffer delete <name>

- Add special "eof" condition necessary with multiple buffers.

- Add -append flag to continue and finish, to append new chars to the
current input string rather than replacing it.

- Add introspection and debugging features such as actions traces,
info-like command, ...

- Finish the documentation

- Create Metrowerks CodeWarrior Pro 4 project file for Macintosh (and
maybe also for Windows, for cross-platform development), and provide
Macintosh binaries

- Maybe add an option to lexers to disable the conditions stack (eg. -nocs, for 
"no conditions stack"), for a better (f)lex compatibility. There is no real 
equivalent to conditions stacks in (f)lex.
