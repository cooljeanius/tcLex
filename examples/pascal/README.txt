This directory contains the scanner for a "toy Pascal-like language",
written using both flex (file pascal.l) and tcLex (file pascal.tcl).
The flex version is extracted from the flex man page. The tcLex
version has been converted by Neil Walker. Each file contains specific
information on how the lexers work.

The file test.p contains a small sample Pascal-like source to test the
lexers on.
